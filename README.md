# Decrypt Files.py

This Python script allows you to decrypt files using the pycryptodome module.

## Requirements

### Install Python
```bash
pkg install python -y
```

### Install pip
```bash
pkg install python-pip
```

### Install pycryptodome
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

## Use
```bash
python 'Decrypt Files.py' "/storage/emulated/0/Documents/Python decrypt files/MEGABOT/files/GTM-HISPEEDðŸ”’.ziv"
```
## Notes

- This script is designed to be used with encrypted files using the same encryption algorithm supported by pycryptodome.
